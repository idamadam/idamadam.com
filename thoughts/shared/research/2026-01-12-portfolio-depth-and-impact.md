# Research: Adding Context and Impact to Portfolio Vignettes

Three design professionals (2 design managers, 1 lead designer) reviewed the portfolio and rated it 3-4/5. The craft and interactive approach are praised, but all three independently identified the same gap: **the work shows what was built, but not the thinking, constraints, or outcomes that would signal lead-level design.**

## Core Finding

The portfolio currently reads as "highly skilled senior" rather than "lead." This isn't about adding more content—it's about reframing existing content to show influence, decisions, and impact.

| What Exists | What's Missing |
|-------------|----------------|
| Problem statement (1 sentence) | Business context, constraints, urgency |
| Solution statement (1 sentence) | Trade-offs considered, decisions made |
| Design notes (UI annotations) | Process insights, research findings |
| Adoption stats (some vignettes) | Outcomes, behavioral shifts, strategic impact |
| Strong craft | Evidence of leadership and influence |

## Feedback Synthesis

### Reviewer 1 (Rating: 4/5)
> "Getting a sense of the setting, the challenges, business context and maybe describe impact or how it solves the problem for people who aren't familiar with the problem space. In a way that doesn't make it too crowded with words."

**Translation:** Add context and impact, but preserve the concise format.

### Reviewer 2 (Rating: 3/5)
> "The problem/solution descriptions are quite high level, and the visuals abstracted—so I didn't get a good sense of the detail of work in a real context... I didn't get a sense of the problem space/trade-offs/process etc. to get a sense of how you think and work with real world constraints."

**Translation:** Show decision-making and constraints, not just outcomes.

### Reviewer 3 (Rating: 4/5)
> "The craft is super strong, but I want something beyond just excellent production. Right now it reads a little like a very highly skilled senior... the most effective showcases I've seen usually have just slightly more context and impact narrative, not just problem/solution."

> "I want to know more about you and your unique approach to design... Right now it's feeling like your identity is 'I like making AI stuff', which is fine, but as a hiring manager I want to know why and what motivates you around that."

**Translation:** Show outcomes and strategic thinking. Answer "why you?"

## Hiring Manager Research: What "Lead-Level" Means in a Portfolio

Research across hiring manager interviews, design leadership articles, and portfolio reviews reveals consistent patterns for what separates senior from lead portfolios.

### The Senior vs Lead Distinction

| Senior Portfolio Shows | Lead Portfolio Shows |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Expert craft | Vision and strategic direction |
| Deep product knowledge | Cross-team influence |
| Complex problem-solving | Organizational coordination |
| Individual ownership | Team enablement |
| Immediate priorities (0-6 months) | Long-term thinking (12+ months) |
| "I designed this feature" | "This changed how the team/org works" |

### What Hiring Managers Actually Look For

From research across multiple sources:

1. **Leadership signals over pure craft** — "Hiring managers expect strong design skills—it's leadership skills that really differentiate a senior portfolio from a junior one."

2. **Strategic decision-making** — "The working out is 90% of it—what decisions did you make and why? I want to see all those decisions articulated."

3. **Honest attribution** — "It may have been a group effort and that is fine—be honest about your contribution."

4. **Impact framing** — "Show the results first. Hiring managers are busy. If you show results first, they'll be more inclined to find out how you got there."

5. **The About page matters** — "The About page is the first place they click once they've decided your work is solid. They're no longer evaluating your process; they're evaluating you."

### The 6-8 Second Reality

Hiring managers spend 6-8 seconds on initial portfolio scans. The vignette format is well-suited for this—but the opening framing must signal business impact, not just project description.

### How to Signal Lead Level

1. **Show T-shaped leadership** — Breadth across responsibilities AND depth for outsized impact
2. **Include leadership artifacts** — Process improvements, strategic planning, knowledge-sharing
3. **Demonstrate influence** — Stakeholder management, building credibility, changing minds
4. **Show team-level outcomes** — Did you influence other projects? Change the design system? Shift company strategy?
5. **Company-first framing** — Multi-scale impact: business + users + team + culture

## The Three Missing Layers

Based on feedback and research, the vignettes need three additional content layers:

### Layer 1: Context (the "before")

**Answers:** Who, where, why now, what constraints?

**Current state:**
> "Synthesizing feedback was the most time-intensive part of performance reviews"

**What's missing:**
- Who experiences this? (Managers? HR? Both?)
- How time-intensive? (Hours? Days per review?)
- Why was this a priority now?
- What constraints shaped the timeline?

**Good context is specific and brief:**
> "Enterprise customers. Managers spending 2+ hours per direct report. Research showed they were already using ChatGPT as a workaround."

### Layer 2: Decisions & Trade-offs (the "how")

**Answers:** What did you consider? What did you decide against? Why?

Design notes currently focus on UI decisions:
> "Tuned the prompts to include specifics like project names, based on user feedback"

**What's missing:**
- What alternatives were on the table?
- What research led to this direction?
- What did you advocate for that wasn't obvious?

**Good decision framing shows thinking:**
> "PM wanted to cut verification features to hit the deadline. Research showed trust was the blocker, not speed. Advocated to keep it—became the pattern for all AI features."

### Layer 3: Impact (the "after")

**Answers:** What changed? For whom? By how much?

**Impact options, ranked by strength:**

| Type | Example | Strength |
|------|---------|----------|
| Hard metrics | "60% reduction in synthesis time" | Strongest |
| Adoption numbers | "12 designers, 30 prototypes created" | Strong |
| Behavioral shift | "Managers went from avoiding AI to requesting it" | Good |
| Strategic outcome | "Findings changed the H2 roadmap" | Good |
| Process change | "Became the standard pattern for AI features" | Acceptable |

**When you don't have metrics:**
> "Success criteria doesn't always have to be metrics—it can be landing a client, launching to get more investors onboard, etc. Showing the thinking alone gets you 80% of the way there."

## What the Research Validates

The vignette approach is the right direction. Research confirms:

- **60-80% visuals, 20-40% text** is the recommended ratio
- **Interactive, explorable experiences** are praised over static case studies
- **Compact format** respects the 6-8 second attention span
- **Show don't tell** is explicitly validated for senior portfolios

The format isn't the problem. The content framing is.

---

## Visual Hierarchy Feedback

Reviewer 3 also noted:
> "There's something a bit unresolved for me in the visual hierarchy. Once I start clicking around I kind of just want to keep clicking rather than taking each project in. I think having several primary actions visible at once contributes to that."

This is a separate issue from content depth, but worth noting for a future pass.

## Identity Questions (For About Section)

Reviewer 3: "I want to know more about you and your unique approach to design."

- Why AI? What draws you to this space?
- What's your design philosophy in one sentence?
- What do you believe that most designers don't?
- What's a hill you'd die on?
- What kind of problems energize you?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fill out the worksheet** for each vignette
2. **Prioritize 2-3 vignettes** that have the strongest answers
3. **Draft new content** for those vignettes first
4. **Test with 1-2 people** before rolling out to all vignettes
5. **Address identity questions** for About section (separate effort)
