## Landing page

I realised that putting a group of strangers together for a couple of weeks to build a portfolio would be a big ask. When thinking about something that people might get value out of, I thought feedback could be a time-boxed activity that everyone could get value from.

To test this idea I created a landing page. I started with a quick mood board and derived a colour palette, typography styles and a logo.  From here, I designed a simple form to get people's emails signed up.

The HTML for the page was simple to set up but I needed a way to collect peoples’ emails. I used Mailchimp to send new signups an automatic email from me confirming that they were in.

Now that the page was built, I needed emails! I asked a couple of friends if they'd be keen and got a couple of emails but it was slow going.

The breakthrough moment for me was when a friend of mine put the link up in a Slack group and I started getting signups from people I didn't know. I took this as a signal that there was at least some demand for a product. It was time to take it to start building.

I diagrammed a rough flow where I'd be manually grouping people together and emailing them to say that they were successfully matched. 

I created a web app which spoke to my database and pulled the details of the users.

After doing this work I sent out emails to a couple of cohorts but I quickly found out that people don’t open their emails. From the people who opened their emails, I found that no one submitted any feedback. Timing may have been an issue since I sent the emails around Christmas/New Year and people could've been with their families.
