To start, I needed to find out if people were interested the idea. I thought a content marketing approach could work, where I could write articles to generate traffic to a site where people could enter their emails in. If people submitted their emails, I could assume that there was some level of interest.

The first thing I did was to look for a domain. This was when the idea started to feel real, something about putting a URL to a project can be very satisfying. 

In the spirit of being lean, instead of coding up a page, I just wrote some content on Notion & linked the domain to this page. You can still see the page I created [here](https://www.notion.so/idam/folio-camp-b64298f3a7ac43b1b6394a46e37fb9ef). I found that writing my thoughts sharpened them as I could get them out of my head & critically engage with them.

There was a bit of a danger in this too. While creating is really fun to do, I found that I was really caught up in making something rather than thinking about it strategically. The outcome of this phase was that I had some content created, but didnâ€™t end up sharing the page.
