## Initial idea & hypothesis

To start, I had to find a problem space to start investigating. Product design portfolios seemed like a good fit as I was familiar with the problem, and I knew plenty of other designers who I might speak to get their understanding. 

My initial hypothesis was that people don't take enough notes to keep track of their projects and help them create their portfolio. Based on this hypothesis, I went out and interviewed a couple of Product Designers. I found that there wasn't a problem with notes as they had developed ways to keep record of the work that they did.

Based on the first set of interviews, I decided on a second hypothesis. This hypothesis was around the portfolio creation process. That compiling a portfolio is a painful, time intensive exercise.

This hypothesis gave me the product idea of creating a time-boxed virtual bootcamp to get their portfolios together. People would sign up, pay a nominal fee and commit to finishing their portfolio in a certain amount of time.
