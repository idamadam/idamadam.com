## Full build

For the next iteration I decided to simplify the surface area of the app. I cut the matchmaking part of the product and focused only on giving and receiving feedback. The product would generate a unique link for every user that they could use to send to anyone they wanted portfolio feedback from. 

To test this idea I decided that I would need authentication to secure user data. My focus shifted from quick product experiments to in-depth technical experimentation. For context, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Australia and we were in our first lockdown. Reading documentation and writing code felt like a good way to spend my time and it made the first couple of months of lockdown fly. 

During this time, I built a web app that did the following:

1. Sign up and log in to the service
2. Generate a unique link for the user
3. Records any feedback that was sent to that user

If you’d like to try it out for yourself, visit [folio.camp](https://folio.camp) and sign up for an account.

After a couple of months, I realised that I had gone down a technical rabbit hole and needed to get the product in front of people again. I asked friends for their help and they quickly got people who'd be interested in using the product.  

Two people signed up and sent their link to get feedback on their portfolios. It was interesting to use what I had built to give feedback. Since the content of each portfolio varied (e.g. the content, the style, the writing), each piece of feedback would need to be unique to that person. The form I built didn't assist with this at all; it was a dumb form for someone to enter that data in. 

### Learnings
I wasn't doing anything to validate whether people wanted the product but just tinkering with what I built. I’ve learnt that I need to figure out how to distill the idea into the smallest testable kernel. It's easy to sink a large amount of time and effort into an idea and get caught up in the execution. The trick is to balance strategy and execution. Both are as important as each other and you can't lose sight of either.
