## Summary

This has been my most ambitious side project yet. Iâ€™m convinced that the best way to learn for me is to try and build something. I learnt a massive amount about the technical side of building an application. Building a usable product & getting people to use it was a massive achievement in itself. The combination of React & Hasura is a pretty potent framework for me to try and experiment with new ideas.

However, I didn't do much product work. I had many assumptions I didn't validate and massively underestimated the amount of time that "simple" technical jobs would take. When you're the only person working on something, the time required to do almost anything blows out. Whilst I'm proud that I could research, design & building out of the idea, I'm not convinced that I used these capabilities the best that I could.

I discovered that I could improve on connecting my ideas to the outside world. I found that I faltered when it came to finding strangers to test with, or to solicit the opinions of people that would find it useful. Writing this essay is my first attempt to push my thinking out there.
