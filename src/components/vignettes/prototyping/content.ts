        'I was building a lot of AI prototypes and needed a way to deploy and share them. But beyond solving my own problem, I wanted to build a discipline of prototyping across the design team. There wasn\'t dedicated engineering for this, but I had the skills to build the infrastructure myself. Making it easy for other designers to get started meant prototyping could become a shared practice, not just something one person did.',
