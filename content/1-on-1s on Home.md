> Helping managers have better conversations with less effort by bringing 1-on-1s to the homepage.

- Linked an adoption goal to a key human problem
- Deep collaboration with other teams
- 255% increase in the weekly number of managers scheduling a 1-on-1 for the first time.

## Discovery and definition

The Culture Amp homepage has historically not had too much useful content for managers & individual contributors. The business had a need to improve the Homepage that so that our customers would get more value out of our software.

I completed a review of existing research which showed that a homepage focused on people and actions resonated with employees and managers. I believed that the first place where the Homepage can start to provide value to Managers is by surfacing 1-on-1s on the Homepage.

I conducted interviews with managers using our platform, our internal People Science team as well as the 1-on-1s team to better understand the problem space.

### Interview insights

#### Managers using CA
- Managers want to understand what's coming up next for them, so that they can be prepared for the conversations they need to have about their direct reports.
- They rely on input from their direct reports to help them have better conversations

#### People Science team
- 1-on-1s need to be 'Real conversations that connect and create change' in order to have the best effect.
- In order to do that, 1-on-1s need to be not just status updates, they need to be co-created and co-owned by the Individual Contributors & the manager

#### 1-on-1 team
- Adoption of the features in our platform were low compared our installed base, however 1-on-1s is the most used feature in our platform.
- In order to get started with 1-on-1s, a manager must schedule a 1-on-1 with their direct report.

### Solution definition
1. Show upcoming 1-on-1s and their status to help managers be prepared to have "real conversations".
2. Show unscheduled 1-on-1s to managers to increase feature adoption.
3. Show a prompt for Individual Contributors to see the status of their upcoming 1-on-1 and encourage them to fill in their check-in.

## Design exploration and testing
### Early exploration
To start, I I looked at the structure of a 1-on-1 in the product to distil that content into an easily understandable, actionable element that provided value and encouraged exploration. I explored things like visual indicators on how the content might be represented & how the design might scale in terms of the number of direct reports a manager might have.

### High fidelity designs and customer testing

> Higher fidelity explorations extending on the ideas in the wireframes

Iterating on the wireframes had given me a structure for what the section could look like. I then fleshed out the wireframes using the Culture Amp UI Kit to create higher fidelity designs.

One of the concepts I identified in the wireframe was a need for a simple text representation of what was in a 1-on-1. I worked with the 1-on-1 team as well as a Content Designer to create a system of smart highlights. This system used the data that 1-on-1s generate to give a manager a preview of the 1-on-1.

I put these designs into a prototype to get customer feedback on the placement of the tiles as well as to understand whether the content was useful or not.

**Customer quote**: "It helps with identifying a trend that is actually quite hard to identify by yourself unless you are going through all those one on ones."

### Interview insights
#### Highlights
- Overall positive feedback about the Direct Reports section.
- Including a manager's direct reports on the homepage made the page a lot more engaging.
- Prompts to set up 1-on-1s were considered helpful as there are no other reminders to set up the feature that's easily accessible.
#### Improvements
- While Direct Reports are important, all users expressed a preference that the tasks be shown at the top than be moved to the middle of the page.

## Final iteration and results
After release, we saw a substantial increase in adoption of 1-on-1s
- 54.3% increase of managers viewing 1-on-1s from the Homepage.
- 255% increase of managers scheduling a 1-on-1 for the first time.
