# Hi, I'm Idam Adam
I'm a Product Designer with 8 years of experience creating intuitive web and mobile products that solve complex business problems through user-centered design.

I excel at diving into murky, complex problem spaces to create simple and elegant design solutions backed with evidence. My approach combines deep user research, technical collaboration, and systematic design thinking to deliver measurable impact. I thrive in team environments that value frequent shipping, high trust and autonomy.

As a bonus, I'm fluent in programming languages and technical frameworks - including Python for AI prompt engineering - which allows me to communicate effectively with engineering teams and directly contribute to technical problem-solving.

Currently, I'm a Lead Product Designer at Culture Amp, where I've led the design of AI-powered features, platform integration systems, and multilingual workflows. My background includes roles at MYOB, Canstar, and Netengine.
